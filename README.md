# CRUD Operations with JavaScript

This is a simple web application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JavaScript. Users can add, edit, delete, and view a list of personal information records in a table format.

## Features

- **Create:** Users can add new personal information records by filling out a form and clicking the "Submit" button.

- **Read:** The application displays a table that lists all the existing personal information records.

- **Update:** Users can edit existing records by clicking the "Edit" button in the table, which populates the form fields for editing. After making changes, they can click the "Update" button to save the changes.

- **Delete:** Users can delete a record by clicking the "Delete" button in the table.

## Technologies Used
